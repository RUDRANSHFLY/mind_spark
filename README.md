- **Gamification**:  
  - **Audio Feedback**: Play positive or negative audio clips for correct and incorrect answers using `just_audio`.  
  - **Haptic Feedback**: Provide tactile responses for user interactions (light impact for correct answers and heavy impact for wrong ones).
- **Screens**:  
  - **Home Screen**: Displays quiz details and allows users to start the quiz.  
  - **Quiz Screen**: Presents questions with multiple-choice answers and provides immediate feedback.  
  - **Result Screen**: Displays the user's score and allows restarting the quiz.
- **Clean Architecture**: Implements the **MVC pattern** to separate concerns and ensure modular code.

## **Project Structure**

The project follows the **MVC structure** for better maintainability and scalability:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # Reusable UI components (e.g., QuizCard, QuestionCard)
â”œâ”€â”€ modal/               # Models for data handling (e.g., QuizInfo, QuizModel)
â”œâ”€â”€ services/            # External service integration (e.g., API service for fetching quiz data)
â”œâ”€â”€ state/               # State management logic using Provider
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/             # Screens of the app (HomeScreen, QuizScreen, ResultScreen)
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart            # Main entry point of the app
```
